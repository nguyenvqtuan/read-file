   - Run `git status` before commits
   - Check staged files with `git diff --cached`
   - Review commit history periodically

### ðŸ”§ If Sensitive Data Was Accidentally Committed

1. **Immediate actions:**

   ```bash
   # Remove from staging
   git reset HEAD <sensitive-file>

   # Remove from tracking
   git rm --cached <sensitive-file>

   # Update .gitignore
   echo "sensitive-file" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **If already pushed:**
   - Rotate/regenerate all exposed credentials
   - Use `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove from history
